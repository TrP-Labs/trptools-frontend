# Mirrors a Locales repository into ./messages, which is what the site's
# strings are compiled from.
#
# Unlike the policies directory, this is *not* read at runtime: the messages
# are compiled into typed functions at build time and tree-shaken, so a string
# that is not in the build is not on the site. That is why the output is
# committed — a build stays reproducible and does not depend on GitHub being
# reachable, and a translation change shows up as a reviewable diff in the
# frontend's own pull request.
#
# The source is authored as JSONC so translators can leave notes for each
# other; the comments are stripped on the way in, because the message format
# plugin reads strict JSON.
#
# Adding a language is deliberately two steps. This script brings the file in;
# listing the locale in project.inlang/settings.json is what actually ships it,
# and that is a decision about whether a translation is complete enough to show
# people.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/pull-locales.sh [owner/repo] [ref]
#   Defaults to TrP-Labs/Locales at prod. Point this at a fork to ship your
#   own wording instead.
